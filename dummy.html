         <h2>Featured Dummies of the Month</h2>

         <p>Some of the dummies are based on real people, such as dummies that represent Penn and Teller. There are puppet representations of many of the U.S. presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush. There are famous dummies, too, such as Lester. Younger kids like Petunia, which was used by Darci Lynn when she won "America’s Got Talent." Some people like Jeff Dunham’s characters, such as Walter and Peanut. Others prefer the older pieces, such as Charlie McCarthy or Jerry Mahoney. </p>
